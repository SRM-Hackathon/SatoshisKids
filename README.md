<h2>Farming as a Servive and Alternative Financial Solutions</h2>
<p>With our application we make it possible for farmers to access a distribution channel and see the value of products giving them good proposition. All this is done keeping in mind the geography of the location, requirements of the farmer, his financial capacities, etc.
 Based on data collected of all past transaction of the farmer we give farmers credit ratings making it possible for financial institution to invest on them with better judgements.
Our application would open up wide possibilities on partnership and investments from banks and private companies.
Fasal offers a unique opportunity to lend money directly to pre-verified borrowers and earn extra income on idle money. The Fasal model provides better rates of interest than the traditional model because it removes the intermediaries and connects the lenders directly to the end users – the borrowers. Our model does not allow a lender to fund more than 20% of a borrower’s loan requirement. This is to encourage Lenders to hedge their risk by diversifying their lending portfolio and not put all their eggs in one basket.
